                      Doom3 goa playground
                      ====================


This is the not fully in place goa environment for Doom3 that builds
[https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3 - dhewm3] for Genode. It is meant for
developers.

Building
--------

# Adjust goarc:

* versions_from_genode_dir <path to genode source>
* run_depot_user           <depot user>
* depot_user               <depot user>

# Change the <depot user> to your user

# Adjust depot user in _used_apis_

# Adjust depot user in _pkg/doom3/archives_

# Checkout desired Sculpt release of Genode
  ! git tags
  will list available Sculpt releases

# Clone doom3 version matching Sculpt release Genode world from
  https://github.com/ssumpf/genode-world/tree/doom3-<Sculpt version>
  (available: 23.04, 23.10, 24.04)

# Import the dhewm3 sources:
  ! goa import

# Build the necessary Genode packages in Genode source directory
  ! <genode-src> ./tool/depot/create <user>/pkg/x86_64/doom3-installation UPDATE_VERSIONS=1 FORCE=1 REBUILD= -j4

# Build and export dhewm3 to Genode depot from this directory
  ! goa export

# How to integrate this into Sculpt OS is up to the developer. Currently, you
  have to rebuild Sculpt because of ongoing Intel GPU driver changes ;)

# The game expects a 'games' file system where the '*.pk4' files and the
  'default.cfg' reside within the 'base' directory.

This all is highly experimental, so use it at your own risk.

Have fun!
